Developed a remotely controlled robotic arm that interpreted and translated live movements of the operator’s arm and hand into robotic commands: https://goo.gl/wXaUkz

For my senior design project, my team and I developed a remotely controlled robotic arm using a novel human-robot interface. Our system, deemed the Helping Hand, 
interprets the live movements of the operator’s arm and hand and translates those movements into commands for the robot. The robotic arm then moves to the correct 
position in order to mimic the operator’s movements. The system uses an external sensor (Leap Motion) to detect the operator’s hand movements as opposed to hardware 
that must be worn by the operator. Such a system has the potential to make complex robotic arms and similar systems accessible to essentially any operator while still 
allowing for precise operator control.
